    "# A dish that can hold more than food\n",

    "One day, while performing an EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity), dr. Elena Vasilescu came across something that was bound to improve her life on the red planet significantly: A satellite dish! It was displaced during the failed landing, and the mechanism to control its motion was totally destroyed. But she figured, if she had a way to make it point towards one of the [Mars Relay Network](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8861/the-mars-relay-network-connects-us-to-nasas-martian-explorers/) satellites, she might be able to establish some kind of communication with the Earth. After all, she did start getting lonely after all this time.\n",

    "Until now, we have seen how we describe a robotic system in a static configuration, either when it is about the relationship between joint position and end-effector position, or when it is about joint velocity and end-effector velocity (but solved for a specific joint configuration). However, one of the most relevant tasks for a robotic system is to be able to plan its trajectory over time. This is important for two reasons: a) it gives us a way to control the velocity of the robot along a specific path b) it allows us to develop obstacle avoidance algorithms.\n",

This is because the numbers of the transformation matrix are not all independent from each other, and each column represents a unit vector. As such, we cannot interpolate the numbers from our starting orientation toward the ending orientation, since the interpolated values are not guaranteed to form unit vectors. Consider the following simple example of interpolating from one unit vector to another:\n",
