    "# Not what she had hoped for\n",
    "\n",
    "dr. Elena Vasilsecu powered on the MARS-O-HELP. She had spent the last couple of [sols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_sol) attaching the satellite dish to the main arm of the robot, and she was getting very enthusiastic about finally communicating with another human. It's been 2 very long months (to be more accurate, 63 sols), and she was finally starting to see the end of the tunnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "She had calculated the trajectory of one of the [Mars Relay Network](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8861/the-mars-relay-network-connects-us-to-nasas-martian-explorers/) satellites, and had converted that into a pose trajectory for the robot. She had prerecorded some messages to be transmitted to the satellites and was waiting for the right moment to start executing the trajectory. While she was waiting, all kind of thoughts run through her head: if she tightened the screws properly, if the transformation from the robot to the Mars frame was correct, whether she used the right Euler angle sequence for calculating the orientation. But time was running low, and she had to focus: if she wanted to track the satellite with her robot, she had to start executing the trajectory in 3,…2,…1,… Now!\n",
    "\n",
    "After she pressed the button, the robot started moving and was executing the trajectory! It was a bliss to watch for a couple of seconds, until suddenly the robot started wiggling, swiveling, and loosing balance…\n",

    "<img src=\"../artwork/stranded/robot_failure.png\" width=60%/>\n",
    "\n",
    "After a loud cry, that was heard by only one person in the whole Universe, she watched the MARS-O-HELP lying on the ground trying to move around the huge satellite dish. She didn't understand, she had everything calculated! What went wrong, why couldn't the MARS-O-HELP follow the designed trajectory? What could she possibly be missing?"

    "## Robot arm process dynamic modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to control a process, we must know how the input to the process affects its output. We usually describe such a relationship with what we call a __dynamic model__ of the process. The relationship is often described in the form of a system of ordinary differential equations: the forces/torques at the joint level and joint states are the __input__ and the acceleration at the joint level is the __output__ of the process. By integrating such equations over time, we can calculate the joint coordinates over time.\n",

    "Differential equations describing input force and output acceleration have been first described by Newton's second law of motion ($ F = m \\ddot{x}$). We could try to model the robot's motion using this law, however it is generally very complicated due to the fact that reaction forces at the joint level are very difficult to calculate. We therefore resort to the more general formulation of physics developed by [Euler and Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation).\n",
