And from the little of telecommunication that dr. Vasilescu knew, she was afraid that her transmission didn't go through the relay network. She had composed a long message with all her recordings up to this date, describing her adventures and struggles. She was hoping that at least people would know more or less what had happened to her, even if parts of her message was not transmitted successfully. Engineers back at home were good at filling in the blanks, and if not, then science fiction writers would do it with a taste of salt.\n",

    "Computed torque control (in some places called feedback linearization control) is a more sophisticated and modern control strategy that can be used to increase the control performances. The control consists out of an inner feedback loop and an outer feedback loop: fig.11.1. Although it is a nonlinear control approach, because the inner feedback loop achieves dynamic linearization, the outer feedback loop resume to a classical linear control design.  \n",

Figure 11.4 shows the tracking errors for the two joint positions  in the case of PD+gravity control. The maximum error is about 0.05 rad (2.8 deg). For the Computed Torque control the results are shown in Figure 11.15. Notice that the maximum error is now much smaller 0.01 rad (0.5 deg).
