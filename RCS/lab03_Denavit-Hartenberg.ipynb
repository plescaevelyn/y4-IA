    "With each hurdle she would overtake, there were a couple of new ones appearing. Dr. Elena Vasilescu felt like a modern Hercules, fighting a [Lernean Hydra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra), where for every problem she solved, two new ones appeared to make her [sols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_sol) less boring. After having obtained a good portion of food supplies and a reliable heat source for the bad days, she realised she will soon be out of oxygen inside her base. So much for all the food she managed to source.\n",

    "Dr. Vasilescu discovered an unrepairable fault in her carbon dioxide converter, the main life support unit of her base. Luckily, there was a spare converter, but it was way too heavy to life with her portable crane attached on her rover, and it was too far away from the robots in the adjacent container she used previously.\n",

    "\n",
    "When studying the kinematics of robots, the forward kinematics is a necessary first step to be taken. In the previous laboratory, we learned how to calculate forward kinematics by placing coordinate frames on the links of articulated robots. Then we calculated the overall transformation by combining the transformations between two subsequent frames. This is a method that works well for simple kinematic chains, however when we have complex link shapes, it can get cumbersome to calculate some transformations. Furthermore, as long as we don't have a standardize procedure for placing the coordinate frames, complicated schematics are necessary to explain where are the frames placed and how are the transformations between them calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these issues, a standardized procedure was  introduced by J. Denavit and R.S. Hartenberg in the article “A kinematic notation for lower pair mechanisms based on matrices”, published in the Journal of Applied Mechanics in 1959 (issue No. 22, pp. 215-221). In the proposed convention, each link can be described using four parameters, which are used to calculate the transformation between two subsequent joints."

Their overall dimensions and shape affect the work envelope and manufacturers are not constrained in employing straight, simple shaped links.

Such transformations relate to the shape and dimensions of the link. \n",

For this course, we use the modified DH convention.

We can add, if necessary, a __tool__ (end effector) for a robot, by declaring the fixed transformation between the last joint frame and the end-effector. We can visualize the DH table of the robot, and we can calculate the position of the end-effector of the robot for a specific set of joint coordinates using the __fkine__ command. Finally, we can visualize the robot for a specific set of joint coordinates by __plot__. "
