    "With the help of the camera system, dr. Elena Vasilescu has managed to identify a very important package that dropped on the surface during the failed landing. If her calculations are correct, the package contains enough food supplies to last for a year, by which time she hopes to be either out of Mars, or have received help from Earth. The camera system reports that the package is located in the following coordinates: $X = -40 m$, $Y = -90 m$, and $Z = 200 m$. The coordinate frame of the box is rotated around the X axis of the camera by -90 degrees. These coordinates are relative to the camera. \n",

    "\n",
    "She can only perform a short trip around the base, using one of the rovers that is equipped with a crane. That is why she needs to identify the location of the package accurately, so she can save time and reduce the risk of getting stranded out of the base.\n",
    "\n",
    "After checking the operations manual from the mission, dr. Vasilescu has determined that the camera system is located at $X = 54m$, $ Y = 220 m$, and $Z= 90 m$ away from her, and is rotated around her Z axis by 180 degrees, and around her X axis by 90 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you help her find the location of the package relative to her base?\n",
    "\n",
    "What maneuvers does she need to perform with her crane to go from her base location to the box. The crane must be aligned with the coordinate system of the box in order to pick it up."
