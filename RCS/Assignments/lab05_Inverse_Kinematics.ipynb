    "Having secured food supplies, reliable heat source, and efficient power lines, dr. Elena Vasilescu had solved her survival issues on the short term. Time to think long term! After doing the calculations, she realized that the current food supplies would last her only 90 sols. That was not too bad, however it was way too short for any rescue mission to reach her, and therefore futile. If only she could create some sort of food supply, she might be able to survive long enough until they come and get her. That is, unless she dies from something else first.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the objectives of the mission was to explore possibilities for growing food on Mars, and therefore they brought some potatoes with them to experiment with. She could decide between eating the potatoes, or trying to multiply them by planting them, which was an easy decision considering the circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plant experimentation was supposed to happen inside a clean room that was set together with the hub. This would reduce the danger of contaminating the plants and increase their yield. But the only way to plant the potatoes in the clean room was using a robot present there.\n",

    "To increase the yield of the plants, she had to create a plan and place the potatoes at specific coordinates on the field. This way, they should be neither too close (reducing yield), nor too far away from each other (wasting space). After she learned forward kinematics, she knew how to calculate the position of the robot for known joint coordinates. But how could she do the __inverse? How could she figure out the joint coordinates necessary so that the robot reaches a certain pose?\n",

    "# Forward versus inverse kinematics\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous laboratories, we analyzed the problem of calculating the pose and velocity of the end-effector of a robot arm under known joint coordinates and velocities. This is what we generally call __forward kinematics__, as it takes us from the variables that we control __directly__ on the robot (joint coordinates, velocities), into quantities that we can only control __indirectly__ (end-effector pose, velocity). Even though forward kinematics is useful, we usually start with a target end-effector pose as our objective, and we need to calculate the joint coordinates that result into the target pose. This is useful since we typically have a target pose that we need to reach with our robot. This is so we interact with an object (e.g., pick a box up), or so we get some sensor data (e.g., take a picture of an object/area).\n",

Even though the orientation matrix consists of 9 elements, not all of them are independent, as they must respect the following constrains:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each column of the matrix must correspond to a vector of unit length\n",
    "* The three columns must represent three vectors perpendicular to each other\n",

    "$$ \\sqrt{X_x^2+X_y^2+X_z^2} = \\sqrt{Y_x^2+Y_y^2+Y_z^2} = \\sqrt{Z_x^2+Z_y^2+Z_z^2} = 1 $$\n",

One way to represent these three rotations, is using the _Euler angles_, which represent a sequence of three rotations, each around one axis.
