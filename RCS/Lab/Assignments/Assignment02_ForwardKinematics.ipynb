    "In the compartment adjacent to dr. Vasilescu is a storage module, which contains a [RTG (Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator) in a box, and a three robot arms that can handle the boxes.\n",

However, she does not have visual information on which of the robots is currently in the position to pick the box. She needs to be very careful which robot to activate as not to damage the RTG unit or any of the other boxes. In the first case, it would mean a slow and painful radioactive death. In the second case, it might mean a really fast and equally painful death due to explosion.\n",
